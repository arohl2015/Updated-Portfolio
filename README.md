# Updated-Portfolio

## Directions:
#### Create an updated portfolio site with the following content:
* Your name
* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
* A link to a PDF of your resume
* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:
    Project title
    Link to the deployed version
    Link to the code on GitHub

#### Design:
* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes
* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
    ** Design Notes: Used Bootstrap to make the site mobile responsive and used an external CSS stylesheet along with style inside the html to make header/footer/button elements design as needed. I also learned new CSS elements to make my icons spin and create an entire background with gradient and custom colors.
